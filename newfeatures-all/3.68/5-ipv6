desc=IPv6 networking support
html=Virtual servers can now have IPv6 addresses in addition to v4, on Debian, Ubuntu, Redhat, CentOS and Fedora systems. Virtualmin will configure BIND to add IPv6 address records, and Apache to accept connections to the IPv6 address. All pages that API commands that deal with addresses have new fields and options for an optional IPv6 address.
