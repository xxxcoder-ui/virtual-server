<header>Home directory</header>

By default, the home directory for a website FTP user is the same as the domain's
base web directory. However, you can change it to be a sub-directory instead,
to limit him to accessing files only in that directory. This assumes that the
FTP server has been setup to restrict clients to their home directories only.
