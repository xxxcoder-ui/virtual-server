<header>BIND DNS Server (for DNS domain)</header>
Enable this if the domain owner account should have the ability to edit DNS records for his domain.  Depending on configuration, the domain owner may create new sub-domain records, modify existing domain records, modify MX records, and more.  Inexperienced users may not want or need this much flexibility.
