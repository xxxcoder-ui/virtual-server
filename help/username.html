<header>Email Address</header>

This field is for entering the username part of the user's email address,
which must be unique within the domain. The user's login name for POP3 and
FTP will be based on whatever you enter - for example, if the username
is <tt>joe</tt> and the domain <tt>swelltech.com</tt>, the POP3 login would
typically be <tt>joe-swelltech</tt>. <p>
