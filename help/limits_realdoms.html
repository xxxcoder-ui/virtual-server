<header>Maximum allowed non-alias servers</header>

This field sets a limit on the number of real non-alias sub-servers that this
server owner may create. This can be set lower than the <b>Maximum allowed virtual servers</b> to allow the user to create lots of alias servers, but restrict
the number of real servers (which consume more disk space and system resources).<p>
