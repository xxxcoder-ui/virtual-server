<header>Can create and edit plans?</header>

This field determines if the reseller is allowed to create his own plans
or edit those that he has already created. If not, only plans created by
root can be used. <p>

Even if a reseller can create plans, the total disk space and other resources
given to virtual servers cannot exceed his limits defined by the master
administrator. <p>
