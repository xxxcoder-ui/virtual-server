<header>Can rename domains?</header>

If this restriction is set to <b>Yes</b>, the server owner will be allowed to
change the domain name of existing virtual servers. Selecting <b>No</b>
prevent this, which is generally a good idea if the owner is not allowed to
create his owner servers either. <p>
