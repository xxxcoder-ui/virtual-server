<header>Maximum allowed alias servers</header>

This field sets a limit on the number of alias-only virtual servers that this
server owner may create. This limit is often used in conjunction with the
<b>Maximum allowed non-alias servers</b> to give a user permissions to create
a higher or unlimited number of aliases for his domains, while still limiting
the number of real virtual servers. <p>
