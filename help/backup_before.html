<header>Command to run before backup</header>

If set, the command or script entered will be run as <tt>root</tt> before
the backup is run on schedule. This can be useful for mounting removable
or remote filesystems to which the backup should be written. <p>

If the command fails (with a non-zero exit status), the rest of the backup
will not proceed. <p>
