<header>File Manager (home directory only)</header>
The File Manager is an advanced Java applet that provides a dual-paned browsable view of the file system on the server.  It is one of the most powerful features of Webmin, and allows even inexperienced users to manage files, directories and permissions, edit text files, upload and download files, and much more.  By default, the domain owner will only be able to see his own directory, and subdirectories.
