<header>Template for default script directory</header>

By default Virtualmin will install new scripts into a sub-directory with
the same name as the script code, like <tt>phpadmin</tt>. This field lets you
enter a template for a different default directory, like <tt>scripts/${SCRIPTNAME}</tt>. All the usual template variables like ${DOM} and ${USER} can be used
as well. <p>
