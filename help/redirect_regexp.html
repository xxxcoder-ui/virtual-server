<header>Include sub-paths in redirect?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, the sub-directory or filename under the source
URL path will <b>not</b> be included in the redirect. For example, if you
redirected <tt>/google</tt> to <tt>http://www.google.com</tt> and a browser
accessed <tt>http://example.com/google/something</tt> , the destination URL
would still be <tt>http://www.google.com</tt>. <p>

If <b>No</b> was selected in this example, the destination would be
<tt>http://www.google.com/something</tt> instead. <p>

However, if <b>Yes</b> is chosen you can use the special code <tt>$1</tt> in
the destination URL. This will be replaced by the sub-path or filename that
comes after the source URL path. <p>
