<header>Use default IPv6 address for new virtual servers?</header>

By default (when this option is set to <b>No</b>), Virtualmin will not add DNS
entries or a webserver configuration to new virtual servers for the system's
default IPv6 address. However, selecting <b>Yes</b> here will change the
default for new domains to use the system's primary IPv6 address. At creation
time the user can still select to use a private IPv6 address or none at all
though. <p>
