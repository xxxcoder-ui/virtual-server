<header>VPOPMail sub-directory for email</header>

This field allows you to customize the sub-directory under each VPOPMail
user's home that will contain email. On systems that don't use the default
of <tt>Maildir</tt>, this will need to be changed to match the actual path used
by VPOPMail - for example, on Gentoo Linux <tt>.maildir</tt> is used. <p>
