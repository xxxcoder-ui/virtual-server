<header>Address format for Apache virtual hosts</header>

This option determines the address format Virtualmin will use in new Apache
&lt;Virtualhost&gt; blocks. A star will match requests that come to any address,
while an IP will only match requests to that specific address. The default
behavior is determined by looking at the Apache version and which 
<tt>NameVirtualHost</tt> directives exist, if any. <p>
