<header>PHP FCGId sub-processes</header>

When PHP scripts for this domain as run via FCGId, the number of PHP processes
set in this field will be kept running at all times to serve requests. You
can increase this from the default of 4 to improve PHP script latency, or
decrease it to reduce memory use. <p>

Setting it to <b>None</b> will cause PHP processes to be launched only
as needed on demand, and to be cleaned up after some period of inactivity.<p>
