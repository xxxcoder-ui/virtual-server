<header>SpamAssassin Mail Filter (for domains config file)</header>
If enabled, the domain owner account will have access to the SpamAssassin configuration module for his domain.  With this module, the policies of SpamAssassin can be customized.  Inexperienced users may be intimidated by this level of control of the spam filter, and could potentially cause an increase in false positives or reduce spam filter effectiveness accidentally.
