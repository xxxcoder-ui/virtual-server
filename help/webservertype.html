<header>Web server type</header>

A virtual webserver can be name-based, or IP-based.  In the vast majority of cases, a name-based virtual server is sufficient.  Only when an SSL site is to be hosted, or an anonymous FTP directory must be provided for the domain, is it necessary to use an IP-based virtual server.
