<header>Login permissions</header>

This menu determines what kind of login access the user is granted. Typically
you will have a choice of email only or email and FTP, but the options can be
customized by the master administrator. <p>

The level of access selected actually sets the shell for the underlying Unix
user, which is then used by the FTP and SSH servers to determine if he can
login or not. <p>
