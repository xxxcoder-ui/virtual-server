<header>Maximum allowed virtual servers</header>

This field sets a limit on the number of virtual servers of any type that
this user can create. If the <b>Cannot create</b> option is selected, he
will not be allowed to add any servers at all. The parent server and all
sub-servers are included in the count towards this limit. <p>
