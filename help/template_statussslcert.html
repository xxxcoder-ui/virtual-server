<header>Validate SSL certificate?</header>

This option determines if SSL certificate validation will be enabled for
new virtual servers created by Webmin that have SSL enabled. You can choose
to have only the expiry date of the certificate checked, or also validate
that the domain name in the certificate matches the virtual server's URL.
<p>

When a domain's certificate gets within 7 days of expiry, Virtualmin will
send an alert email to the virtual server owner giving him time to order a
renewal. <p>
