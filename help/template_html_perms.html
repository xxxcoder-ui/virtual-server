<header>Permissions on website directory</header>
 This option specifies the initial permissions on the files and directories within the website directory specified in the previous option.  If SuExec has been enabled, and the Apache user is added to the virtual server user group, these permissions can be tightened to prevent other users from seeing the contents of the website directory.  This tightened set of permissions is recommended for any deployment unless all users with shell access are trusted users.  The recommended permissions are 750, which equals rwxr-x---.  In other words, the owner can read, write and execute, the group can read and execute, and others have no permissions to read, write or execute files within the directory.
