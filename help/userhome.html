<header>Home directory</header>

This field can be used to choose a custom home directory for a mailbox user.
For example, you may want his home to be under the <tt>public_html</tt>
directory, so that he can easily create web files. However, in most cases it
should just be set the <b>Automatic</b>. <p>
