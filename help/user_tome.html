<header>Deliver to this user normally</header>

When this option is checked, email to this user will be delivered to his
mailbox, after passing through any spam filtering. Normally you do not need
to check this, as it will happen automatically if no other forwarding or
autoreply is enabled. However, if you do setup a forwarding address or
automatic reply but still want the user to keep a copy of his email, this
option should be selected. <p>
